 Clean up all initialized subsystems.

 You should call this function even if you have already shutdown each
 initialized subsystem with SDL_QuitSubSystem(). It is safe to call this
 function even in the case of errors in initialization.

 If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function
 (for example SDL_VideoInit()) instead of SDL_Init() or SDL_InitSubSystem(),
 then you must use that subsystem's quit function (SDL_VideoQuit()) to shut
 it down before calling SDL_Quit(). But generally, you should not be using
 those functions directly anyhow; use SDL_Init() instead.

 You can use this function with atexit() to ensure that it is run when your
 application is shutdown, but it is not wise to do this from a library or
 other dynamically loaded code.

        <member name="M:SDL_GetPreferredLocales">
 Report the user's preferred locale.

 This returns an array of SDL_Locale structs, the final item zeroed out.
 When the caller is done with this array, it should call SDL_free() on the
 returned value; all the memory involved is allocated in a single block, so
 a single SDL_free() will suffice.

 Returned language strings are in the format xx, where 'xx' is an ISO-639
 language specifier (such as "en" for English, "de" for German, etc).
 Country strings are in the format YY, where "YY" is an ISO-3166 country
 code (such as "US" for the United States, "CA" for Canada, etc). Country
 might be NULL if there's no specific guidance on them (so you might get {
 "en", "US" } for American English, but { "en", NULL } means "English
 language, generically"). Language strings are never NULL, except to
 terminate the array.

 Please note that not all of these strings are 2 characters; some are three
 or more.

 The returned list of locales are in the order of the user's preference. For
 example, a German citizen that is fluent in US English and knows enough
 Japanese to navigate around Tokyo might have a list like: { "de", "en_US",
 "jp", NULL }. Someone from England might prefer British English (where
 "color" is spelled "colour", etc), but will settle for anything like it: {
 "en_GB", "en", NULL }.

 This function returns NULL on error, including when the platform does not
 supply this information at all.

 This might be a "slow" call that has to query the operating system. It's
 best to ask for this once and save the results. However, this list can
 change, usually because the user has changed a system preference outside of
 your program; SDL will send an SDL_LOCALECHANGED event in this case, if
 possible, and you can call this function again to get an updated copy of
 preferred locales.

 \return array of locales, terminated with a locale with a NULL language
         field. Will return NULL on error.

 Obsolete function, do not use.

 When SDL was hosted in a Mercurial repository, and was built carefully,
 this would return the revision number that the build was created from. This
 number was not reliable for several reasons, but more importantly, SDL is
 now hosted in a git repository, which does not offer numbers at all, only
 hashes. This function only ever returns zero now. Don't use it.

 Before SDL 2.0.16, this might have returned an unreliable, but non-zero
 number.

 \deprecated Use SDL_GetRevision() instead; if SDL was carefully built, it
             will return a git hash.

 The revision is arbitrary string (a hash value) uniquely identifying the
 exact revision of the SDL library in use, and is only useful in comparing
 against other revisions. It is NOT an incrementing number.

 If SDL wasn't built from a git repository with the appropriate tools, this
 will return an empty string.

 Macro to determine SDL version program was compiled against.

 This macro fills in a SDL_version structure with the version of the
 library you compiled against. This is determined by what header the
 compiler uses. Note that if you dynamically linked the library, you might
 have a slightly newer or older version at runtime. That version can be
 determined with SDL_GetVersion(), which, unlike SDL_VERSION(),
 is not a macro.

 Call a callback function at a future time.

 If you use this function, you must pass `SDL_INIT_TIMER` to SDL_Init().

 The callback function is passed the current timer interval and the user
 supplied parameter from the SDL_AddTimer() call and should return the next
 timer interval. If the value returned from the callback is 0, the timer is
 canceled.

 The callback is run on a separate thread.

 Timers take into account the amount of time it took to execute the
 callback. For example, if the callback took 250 ms to execute and returned
 1000 (ms), the timer would only wait another 750 ms before its next
 iteration.

 Timing may be inexact due to OS scheduling. Be sure to note the current
 time with SDL_GetTicks() or SDL_GetPerformanceCounter() in case your
 callback needs to adjust for variances.

 Compare 32-bit SDL ticks values, and return true if `A` has passed `B`.

 This should be used with results from SDL_GetTicks(), as this macro
 attempts to deal with the 32-bit counter wrapping back to zero every ~49
 days, but should _not_ be used with SDL_GetTicks64(), which does not have
 that problem.

 For example, with SDL_GetTicks(), if you want to wait 100 ms, you could
 do this:

 ```c
 const Uint32 timeout = SDL_GetTicks() + 100;
 while (!SDL_TICKS_PASSED(SDL_GetTicks(), timeout)) {

 Get the user-and-app-specific path where files can be written.

 Get the "pref dir". This is meant to be where users can write personal
 files (preferences and save games, etc) that are specific to your
 application. This directory is unique per user, per application.

 This function will decide the appropriate location in the native
 filesystem, create the directory if necessary, and return a string of the
 absolute path to the directory in UTF-8 encoding.

 On Windows, the string might look like:

 `C:\\Users\\bob\\AppData\\Roaming\\My Company\\My Program Name\\`

 On Linux, the string might look like"

 `/home/bob/.local/share/My Program Name/`

 On Mac OS X, the string might look like:

 `/Users/bob/Library/Application Support/My Program Name/`

 You should assume the path returned by this function is the only safe place
 to write files (and that SDL_GetBasePath(), while it might be writable, or
 even the parent of the returned path, isn't where you should be writing
 things).

 Both the org and app strings may become part of a directory name, so please
 follow these rules:

 - Try to use the same org string (_including case-sensitivity_) for all
   your applications that use this function.
 - Always use a unique app string for each one, and make sure it never
   changes for an app once you've decided on it.
 - Unicode characters are legal, as long as it's UTF-8 encoded, but...
 - ...only use letters, numbers, and spaces. Avoid punctuation like "Game
   Name 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!" ... "Game Name 2" is sufficient.

 The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\' on
 Windows, '/' on most other platforms).

 Set up a filter to process all events before they change internal state and
 are posted to the internal event queue.

 If the filter function returns 1 when called, then the event will be added
 to the internal queue. If it returns 0, then the event will be dropped from
 the queue, but the internal state will still be updated. This allows
 selective filtering of dynamically arriving events.

 **WARNING**: Be very careful of what you do in the event filter function,
 as it may run in a different thread!

 On platforms that support it, if the quit event is generated by an
 interrupt signal (e.g. pressing Ctrl-C), it will be delivered to the
 application at the next event poll.

 There is one caveat when dealing with the ::SDL_QuitEvent event type. The
 event filter is only called when the window manager desires to close the
 application window. If the event filter returns 1, then the window will be
 closed, otherwise the window will remain open if possible.

 Note: Disabled events never make it to the event filter function; see
 SDL_EventState().

 Note: If you just want to inspect events without filtering, you should use
 SDL_AddEventWatch() instead.

 Note: Events pushed onto the queue with SDL_PushEvent() get passed through
 the event filter, but events pushed onto the queue with SDL_PeepEvents() do
 not.

 Add an event to the event queue.

 The event queue can actually be used as a two way communication channel.
 Not only can events be read from the queue, but the user can also push
 their own events onto it. `event` is a pointer to the event structure you
 wish to push onto the queue. The event is copied into the queue, and the
 caller may dispose of the memory pointed to after SDL_PushEvent() returns.

 Note: Pushing device input events onto the queue doesn't modify the state
 of the device within SDL.

 This function is thread-safe, and can be called from other threads safely.

 Note: Events pushed onto the queue with SDL_PushEvent() get passed through
 the event filter but events added with SDL_PeepEvents() do not.

 get an event type that does not conflict with other code that also wants
 its own custom event types.

 a device at rest will have an value of SDL_STANDARD_GRAVITY away
 from the center of the earth.

 values[0]: Acceleration on the x axis
 values[1]: Acceleration on the y axis
 values[2]: Acceleration on the z axis

 For phones held in portrait mode and game controllers held in front of you,
 the axes are defined as follows:
 -X ... +X : left ... right
 -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
 -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
 
 The axis data is not changed when the phone is rotated.

 \sa SDL_GetDisplayOrientation()

 Gyroscope sensor

 The gyroscope returns the current rate of rotation in radians per second.
 The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction. That is,
 an observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would
 see positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating
 counter-clockwise.

 values[0]: Angular speed around the x axis (pitch)
 values[1]: Angular speed around the y axis (yaw)
 values[2]: Angular speed around the z axis (roll)

 For phones held in portrait mode and game controllers held in front of you,
 the axes are defined as follows:
 -X ... +X : left ... right
 -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
 -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
 
 The axis data is not changed when the phone or controller is rotated.

 \sa SDL_GetDisplayOrientation()

 Locking for multi-threaded access to the sensor API

 If you are using the sensor API or handling events from multiple threads
 you should use these locking functions to protect access to the sensors.

 In particular, you are guaranteed that the sensor list won't change, so the
 API functions that take a sensor index will be valid, and sensor events
 will not be delivered.

 interface, so you know that a specific axis is the "left thumb stick," etc.

 Capture the mouse and to track input outside an SDL window.

 Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just
 within your window. Not all video targets support this function. When
 capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events, but
 unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is not
 restrained to your window.

 This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
 your application and others on the system--so you should use this function
 sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to track the
 mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse
 button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
 of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
 probably use SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowGrab(), depending
 on your goals.

 While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
 current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
 bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only allowed
 for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while capturing, the
 capture will be disabled automatically.

 While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
 `SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE` flag set.

 \param enabled SDL_TRUE to enable capturing, SDL_FALSE to disable.

 Note: SDL_GetMouseState() returns the mouse position as SDL understands it
 from the last pump of the event queue. This function, however, queries the
 OS for the current mouse position, and as such, might be a slightly less

 Get an OpenGL function by name.

 If the GL library is loaded at runtime with SDL_GL_LoadLibrary(), then all
 GL functions must be retrieved this way. Usually this is used to retrieve
 function pointers to OpenGL extensions.

 There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some
 extra care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle
 these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:

 - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
   this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
   before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or
   create a second context, you should assume that any existing function
   pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a
   Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer
   this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
   work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
   of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
 - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
   context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
   This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
   look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that
   is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
   available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
   existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),
   or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
   as core functionality.
 - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function
   isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
   extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that
   extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
   can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.
 - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
   Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
   make the same promises about function pointers.
 - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example
   code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
   platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.

 Provide a callback that decides if a window region has special properties.

 Normally windows are dragged and resized by decorations provided by the
 system window manager (a title bar, borders, etc), but for some apps, it
 makes sense to drag them from somewhere else inside the window itself; for
 example, one might have a borderless window that wants to be draggable from
 any part, or simulate its own title bar, etc.

 This function lets the app provide a callback that designates pieces of a
 given window as special. This callback is run during event processing if we
 need to tell the OS to treat a region of the window specially; the use of
 this callback is known as "hit testing."

 Mouse input may not be delivered to your application if it is within a
 special area; the OS will often apply that input to moving the window or
 resizing the window and not deliver it to the application.

 Specifying NULL for a callback disables hit-testing. Hit-testing is
 disabled by default.

 Platforms that don't support this functionality will return -1
 unconditionally, even if you're attempting to disable hit-testing.

 Your callback may fire at any time, and its firing does not indicate any
 specific behavior (for example, on Windows, this certainly might fire when
 the OS is deciding whether to drag your window, but it fires for lots of
 other reasons, too, some unrelated to anything you probably care about _and
 when the mouse isn't actually at the location it is testing_). Since this
 can fire at any time, you should try to keep your callback efficient,
 devoid of allocations, etc.

 Create a window with the specified position, dimensions, and flags.

 `flags` may be any of the following OR'd together:

 - `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN`: fullscreen window
 - `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP`: fullscreen window at desktop resolution
 - `SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL`: window usable with an OpenGL context
 - `SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN`: window usable with a Vulkan instance
 - `SDL_WINDOW_METAL`: window usable with a Metal instance
 - `SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN`: window is not visible
 - `SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS`: no window decoration
 - `SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE`: window can be resized
 - `SDL_WINDOW_MINIMIZED`: window is minimized
 - `SDL_WINDOW_MAXIMIZED`: window is maximized
 - `SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_GRABBED`: window has grabbed input focus
 - `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI`: window should be created in high-DPI mode if
   supported (&gt;= SDL 2.0.1)

 `SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN` is ignored by SDL_CreateWindow(). The SDL_Window is
 implicitly shown if SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN is not set. `SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN` may be
 queried later using SDL_GetWindowFlags().

 On Apple's macOS, you **must** set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info.plist
 property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High-DPI OpenGL canvas.

 If the window is created with the `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` flag, its size
 in pixels may differ from its size in screen coordinates on platforms with
 high-DPI support (e.g. iOS and macOS). Use SDL_GetWindowSize() to query the
 client area's size in screen coordinates, and SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize() or
 SDL_GetRendererOutputSize() to query the drawable size in pixels.

 If the window is set fullscreen, the width and height parameters `w` and
 `h` will not be used. However, invalid size parameters (e.g. too large) may
 still fail. Window size is actually limited to 16384 x 16384 for all
 platforms at window creation.

 If the window is created with any of the SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL or
 SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN flags, then the corresponding LoadLibrary function
 (SDL_GL_LoadLibrary or SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary) is called and the
 corresponding UnloadLibrary function is called by SDL_DestroyWindow().

 If SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN is specified and there isn't a working Vulkan driver,
 SDL_CreateWindow() will fail because SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary() will fail.

 If SDL_WINDOW_METAL is specified on an OS that does not support Metal,
 SDL_CreateWindow() will fail.

 On non-Apple devices, SDL requires you to either not link to the Vulkan
 loader or link to a dynamic library version. This limitation may be removed
 in a future version of SDL.

 Allocate a new RGB surface.

 If `depth` is 4 or 8 bits, an empty palette is allocated for the surface.
 If `depth` is greater than 8 bits, the pixel format is set using the
 [RGBA]mask parameters.

 The [RGBA]mask parameters are the bitmasks used to extract that color from
 a pixel. For instance, `Rmask` being 0xFF000000 means the red data is
 stored in the most significant byte. Using zeros for the RGB masks sets a
 default value, based on the depth. For example:

 ```c++
 SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0,w,h,32,0,0,0,0);
 ```

 However, using zero for the Amask results in an Amask of 0.

 By default surfaces with an alpha mask are set up for blending as with:

 ```c++
 SDL_SetSurfaceBlendMode(surface, SDL_BLENDMODE_BLEND)
 ```

 You can change this by calling SDL_SetSurfaceBlendMode() and selecting a
 different `blendMode`.

 Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.

 The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept
 the SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.

 A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
 combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
 components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their
 blend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and
 calculates the result that will get stored in the render target.

 Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:

 ```c
 dstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);
 dstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);
 ```

 Where the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,
 dst)` can return one of the following:

 - `src + dst`
 - `src - dst`
 - `dst - src`
 - `min(src, dst)`
 - `max(src, dst)`

 The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
 second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The
 fourth component is not used.

 The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the
 SDL_BlendFactor. The other components are not used in the alpha
 calculation.

 Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a
 specific SDL_BlendMode is supported, create a renderer and pass it to
 either SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode or SDL_SetTextureBlendMode. They will
 return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.

 This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer in
 SDL 2.0.6. All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the
 SDL_BlendMode enumeration.

 - **direct3d**: Supports `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` with all factors.
 - **direct3d11**: Supports all operations with all factors. However, some
   factors produce unexpected results with `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM` and
   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM`.
 - **opengl**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all
   factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly with SDL
   2.0.6.
 - **opengles**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all
   factors. Color and alpha factors need to be the same. OpenGL ES 1
   implementation specific: May also support `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`
   and `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`. May support color and alpha
   operations being different from each other. May support color and alpha
   factors being different from each other.
 - **opengles2**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD`,
   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`, `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`
   operations with all factors.
 - **psp**: No custom blend mode support.
 - **software**: No custom blend mode support.

 Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render
 target. The `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA` and
 `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA` factors do not have an effect in this
 case.

 \param srcColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
                       blue components of the source pixels
 \param dstColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
                       blue components of the destination pixels
 \param colorOperation the SDL_BlendOperation used to combine the red,
                       green, and blue components of the source and
                       destination pixels
 \param srcAlphaFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the alpha component of
                       the source pixels
 \param dstAlphaFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the alpha component of
                       the destination pixels
 \param alphaOperation the SDL_BlendOperation used to combine the alpha
                       component of the source and destination pixels
 \returns an SDL_BlendMode that represents the chosen factors and
          operations.

 64. To be clear: if you can't decide to use an instruction set with an
 SDL_Has*() function, don't use that instruction set with memory allocated
 through here.

 SDL_AllocSIMD(0) will return a non-NULL pointer, assuming the system isn't
 out of memory, but you are not allowed to dereference it (because you only
 own zero bytes of that buffer).

 \param len The length, in bytes, of the block to allocate. The actual
            allocated block might be larger due to padding, etc.
 \returns a pointer to the newly-allocated block, NULL if out of memory.

 Calling this function from inside your audio callback is unnecessary. SDL

 your application locks the device, sets a few variables and unlocks again.

 It is safe to lock the audio device multiple times, as long as you unlock
 it an equivalent number of times. The callback will not run until the

 If you are looking to queue audio for output on a non-callback playback
 device, you want SDL_QueueAudio() instead. SDL_DequeueAudio() will always
 return 0 if you use it with playback devices.

 SDL offers two ways to retrieve audio from a capture device: you can either
 supply a callback that SDL triggers with some frequency as the device
 records more audio data, (push method), or you can supply no callback, and
 then SDL will expect you to retrieve data at regular intervals (pull
 method) with this function.

 There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of
 exhaustion of address space. Data from the device will keep queuing as
 necessary without further intervention from you. This means you will
 eventually run out of memory if you aren't routinely dequeueing data.

 Capture devices will not queue data when paused; if you are expecting to
 not need captured audio for some length of time, use SDL_PauseAudioDevice()
 to stop the capture device from queueing more data. This can be useful
 during, say, level loading times. When unpaused, capture devices will start
 queueing data from that point, having flushed any capturable data available
 while paused.

 This function is thread-safe, but dequeueing from the same device from two
 threads at once does not promise which thread will dequeue data first.

 This function copies the supplied data, so you are safe to free it when the

 Convert audio data to a desired audio format.

 This function does the actual audio data conversion, after the application
 has called SDL_BuildAudioCVT() to prepare the conversion information and
 then filled in the buffer details.

 Once the application has initialized the `cvt` structure using
 SDL_BuildAudioCVT(), allocated an audio buffer and filled it with audio
 data in the source format, this function will convert the buffer, in-place,
 to the desired format.

 The data conversion may go through several passes; any given pass may
 possibly temporarily increase the size of the data. For example, SDL might
 expand 16-bit data to 32 bits before resampling to a lower frequency,
 shrinking the data size after having grown it briefly. Since the supplied
 buffer will be both the source and destination, converting as necessary
 in-place, the application must allocate a buffer that will fully contain
 the data during its largest conversion pass. After SDL_BuildAudioCVT()
 returns, the application should set the `cvt-&gt;len` field to the size, in
 bytes, of the source data, and allocate a buffer that is `cvt-&gt;len *
 cvt-&gt;len_mult` bytes long for the `buf` field.

 The source data should be copied into this buffer before the call to
 SDL_ConvertAudio(). Upon successful return, this buffer will contain the
 converted audio, and `cvt-&gt;len_cvt` will be the size of the converted data,
 in bytes. Any bytes in the buffer past `cvt-&gt;len_cvt` are undefined once
 this function returns.

 \param cvt an SDL_AudioCVT structure that was previously set up by

 Use this function to pause and unpause audio playback on a specified

 This function pauses and unpauses the audio callback processing for a given

 call this function with **pause_on**=0 after opening the specified audio
 device to start playing sound. This allows you to safely initialize data
 for your callback function after opening the audio device. Silence will be
 written to the audio device while paused, and the audio callback is
 guaranteed to not be called. Pausing one device does not prevent other
 unpaused devices from running their callbacks.

 Pausing state does not stack; even if you pause a device several times, a
 single unpause will start the device playing again, and vice versa. This is
 different from how SDL_LockAudioDevice() works.

 If you just need to protect a few variables from race conditions vs your

 in the audio playback. Instead, you should use SDL_LockAudioDevice().

 Open a specific audio device.

 SDL_OpenAudio(), unlike this function, always acts on device ID 1. As such,
 this function will never return a 1 so as not to conflict with the legacy

 Please note that SDL 2.0 before 2.0.5 did not support recording; as such,
 this function would fail if `iscapture` was not zero. Starting with SDL
 2.0.5, recording is implemented and this value can be non-zero.

 Passing in a `device` name of NULL requests the most reasonable default
 (and is equivalent to what SDL_OpenAudio() does to choose a device). The
 `device` name is a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName(), but
 some drivers allow arbitrary and driver-specific strings, such as a
 hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the
 diskaudio driver.

 An opened audio device starts out paused, and should be enabled for playing
 by calling SDL_PauseAudioDevice(devid, 0) when you are ready for your audio
 callback function to be called. Since the audio driver may modify the
 requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate any local mixing
 buffers after you open the audio device.

 The audio callback runs in a separate thread in most cases; you can prevent
 race conditions between your callback and other threads without fully
 pausing playback with SDL_LockAudioDevice(). For more information about the
 callback, see SDL_AudioSpec.

 Managing the audio spec via 'desired' and 'obtained':

 When filling in the desired audio spec structure:

 - `desired-&gt;freq` should be the frequency in sample-frames-per-second (Hz).
 - `desired-&gt;format` should be the audio format (`AUDIO_S16SYS`, etc).
 - `desired-&gt;samples` is the desired size of the audio buffer, in _sample
   frames_ (with stereo output, two samples--left and right--would make a
   single sample frame). This number should be a power of two, and may be
   adjusted by the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.
   Good values seem to range between 512 and 8096 inclusive, depending on
   the application and CPU speed. Smaller values reduce latency, but can
   lead to underflow if the application is doing heavy processing and cannot
   fill the audio buffer in time. Note that the number of sample frames is
   directly related to time by the following formula: `ms =
   (sampleframes*1000)/freq`
 - `desired-&gt;size` is the size in _bytes_ of the audio buffer, and is
   calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.
 - `desired-&gt;silence` is the value used to set the buffer to silence, and is
   calculated by SDL_OpenAudioDevice(). You don't initialize this.
 - `desired-&gt;callback` should be set to a function that will be called when
   the audio device is ready for more data. It is passed a pointer to the
   audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer. This function
   usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should protect data
   structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudioDevice() and
   SDL_UnlockAudioDevice() in your code. Alternately, you may pass a NULL
   pointer here, and call SDL_QueueAudio() with some frequency, to queue
   more audio samples to be played (or for capture devices, call
   SDL_DequeueAudio() with some frequency, to obtain audio samples).
 - `desired-&gt;userdata` is passed as the first parameter to your callback
   function. If you passed a NULL callback, this value is ignored.

 `allowed_changes` can have the following flags OR'd together:

 - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE`
 - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE`
 - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE`
 - `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE`

 These flags specify how SDL should behave when a device cannot offer a
 specific feature. If the application requests a feature that the hardware
 doesn't offer, SDL will always try to get the closest equivalent.

 For example, if you ask for float32 audio format, but the sound card only
 supports int16, SDL will set the hardware to int16. If you had set
 SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE, SDL will change the format in the `obtained`
 structure. If that flag was *not* set, SDL will prepare to convert your
 callback's float32 audio to int16 before feeding it to the hardware and
 will keep the originally requested format in the `obtained` structure.

 The resulting audio specs, varying depending on hardware and on what
 changes were allowed, will then be written back to `obtained`.

 If your application can only handle one specific data format, pass a zero
 for `allowed_changes` and let SDL transparently handle any differences.

 \param device a UTF-8 string reported by SDL_GetAudioDeviceName() or a
               driver-specific name as appropriate. NULL requests the most
               reasonable default device.

  \name RWFrom functions

  Functions to create SDL_RWops structures from various data streams.

 Use this function to create a new SDL_RWops structure for reading from
 and/or writing to a named file.

 The `mode` string is treated roughly the same as in a call to the C
 library's fopen(), even if SDL doesn't happen to use fopen() behind the
 scenes.

 Available `mode` strings:

 - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
 - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
   already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
   empty file.
 - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
   file. The file is created if it does not exist.
 - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
   exist.
 - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
   the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
   treated as a new empty file.
 - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
   performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
   overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
   anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.

 **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
 be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
 be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
 modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
 letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
 Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
 effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
 a text file.

 This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
 format, regardless of the underlying operating system.

 As a fallback, SDL_RWFromFile() will transparently open a matching filename
 in an Android app's `assets`.

 Closing the SDL_RWops will close the file handle SDL is holding internally.

 Let a thread clean up on exit without intervention.

 A thread may be "detached" to signify that it should not remain until

  We compile SDL into a DLL. This means, that it's the DLL which
  creates a new thread for the calling process with the SDL_CreateThread()
  API. There is a problem with this, that only the RTL of the SDL2.DLL will
  be initialized for those threads, and not the RTL of the calling
  application!

  To solve this, we make a little hack here.

  We'll always use the caller's _beginthread() and _endthread() APIs to
  start a new thread. This way, if it's the SDL2.DLL which uses this API,
  then the RTL of SDL2.DLL will be used to create the new thread, and if it's

 Memory barriers are designed to prevent reads and writes from being
 reordered by the compiler and being seen out of order on multi-core CPUs.

 A typical pattern would be for thread A to write some data and a flag, and
 for thread B to read the flag and get the data. In this case you would
 insert a release barrier between writing the data and the flag,
 guaranteeing that the data write completes no later than the flag is
 written, and you would insert an acquire barrier between reading the flag
 and reading the data, to ensure that all the reads associated with the flag
 have completed.

 In this pattern you should always see a release barrier paired with an
 acquire barrier and you should gate the data reads/writes with a single
 flag variable.

   * - `"stackLimit": integer`
   *   - Exceeding stackLimit (recursive depth of `readValue()`) will cause an

   *   - This is a security issue (seg-faults caused by deeply nested JSON), so
   *     the default is low.
   * - `"failIfExtra": false or true`
   *   - If true, `parse()` returns false when extra non-whitespace trails the
   *     JSON value in the input string.
   * - `"rejectDupKeys": false or true`
   *   - If true, `parse()` returns false when a key is duplicated within an
   *     object.
   * - `"allowSpecialFloats": false or true`
   *   - If true, special float values (NaNs and infinities) are allowed and

 \brief Constructs a value from a static string.

 Like other value string constructor but do not duplicate the string for
 internal storage. The given string must remain alive after the call to
 this constructor.

 \note This works only for null-terminated strings. (We cannot change the
 size of this class, so we have nowhere to store the length, which might be
 computed later for various operations.)

 Example of usage:
   \code
   static StaticString foo("some text");
   Json::Value aValue(foo);

 \brief Create a default Value of the given type.

 This is a very useful constructor.
 To create an empty array, pass arrayValue.
 To create an empty object, pass objectValue.
 Another Value can then be set to this one by assignment.
 This is useful since clear() and resize() will not alter types.

 Examples:
   \code
   Json::Value null_value; // null
   Json::Value arr_value(Json::arrayValue); // []
   Json::Value obj_value(Json::objectValue); // {}
